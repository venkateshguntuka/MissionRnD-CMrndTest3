/*

Given two Binary Search Trees ,Merge Both of them into a Single Binary Search Tree .
The Resultant Binary Search Tree will be BST1 .ie Merge all elements of BST2 into BST1.

Example 1:
Input : 
   20        25
  /  \      /  \
 5    30   10   35
Output :
Bst 1 :
     20
   /   \
  5     30
   \   /  \
   10 25   35

BST 2 can be merged in BST1 sometimes in many number of ways ,Any 1 of those correct ways would be fine .
Finally All elements of Both Trees should be in BST 1 .Dont process NULL Inputs 
(Both r1 and r2 shouldnt be NULL at the time of Input)

Note : Dont Create Nodes using malloc,or Swap the data values or else your solution would receive 100%
cut in the marks you got for this question .
You need to solve this question only by changing links.

You will also receive Bonus marks for any better optimizations you make .
Difficulty : Medium -Hard
